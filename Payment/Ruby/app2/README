  AT&T API Platform Samples - Payment app 2
 ----------------------------------

This file describes how to set up, configure and run the Ruby applications using AT&T API Platform services. 
It covers all steps required to register the application on DevConnect and, based on the generated API keys and secrets, 
create and run one's own full-fledged sample applications.

  1. Configuration
  2. Installation
  3. Parameters
  4. Running the application


1. Configuration

  Configuration consists of a few steps necessary to get an application registered on DevConnect with the proper services and 
  endpoints, depending on the type of client-side application (autonomous/non-autonomous). 

  To register an application, go to https://devconnect-api.att.com/ and login with your valid username and password.
  Next, choose "My Page" from the bar at the top of the page and click the "Setup a New Application" button. 

  Fill in the form, in particular all fields marked as "required". 

  Be careful while filling in the "OAuth Redirect URL" field. It should contain the URL that the oAuth provider will redirect
  users to when he/she successfully authenticates and authorizes your application.

  Having your application registered, you will get back an important pair of data: an API key and Secret key. They are 
  necessary to get your applications working with the AT&T Platform APIs. See 'Adjusting parameters' below to learn how to use 
  these keys.

  Initially your newly registered application is restricted to the "Sandbox" environment only. To move it to production,
  you may promote it by clicking the "Promote to production" button. Notice that you will get a different API key and secret,
  so these values in your application should be adjusted accordingly.

  Depending on the kind of authentication used, an application may be based on either the Autonomous Client or the Web-Server 
  Client OAuth flow (see https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/autonomous-client-application-oauth-flow or
  https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/web-server-client-application-oauth-flow respectively).


2. Installation

** Requirements

   To run the examples you need ruby 1.8+ and a few gems that the applications are heavily based on:

     - sinatra (http://www.sinatrarb.com/) 
       used to construct a simple web application and manage URLs within.

  	 - eventmachine
  
	 To ensure installation of the sinatra-contrib gem you must first install the gem eventmachine. Sinatra-contrib has a dependency on eventmachine. 
	 EventMachine enables programs to easily interface with other programs using TCP/IP, especially if custom protocols are required.

     - sinatra-contrib 
       Additional set of useful helpers, including ones used to read    settings from external files.

     - Also make sure you have rest-client and json gems installed. 

   	To install these gems open up a terminal window and invoke:

     - gem install sinatra eventmachine sinatra-contrib rest-client json

	If you are experiencing any additional difficulties installing gems, particularly sinatra-contrib, it may prove useful to install the ruby gem thin. This can be installed in the terminal by invoking:

	 - gem install thin

   Having them installed, you are almost ready to run the sample applications.

** Setting up on a different port number

   In case multiple applications need to be run at the same time, you need to consider using different 
   port numbers.

   By default sinatra uses port number 4567 and only one running application may use this port. In case 
   you want to run one more sinatra-based application, you need to change its port number, eg. to 4568. This way you 
   may have each application running on a unique port.


3. Parameters

   Payment application 2 contains two config files. These files are config.yml and configNotary.yml. The config.yml file holds configurable parameters for the Payment application.
   The configNotary.yml file holds configurable parameters for the Notary application. Both the config.yml and configNotary.yml files must share the same api_key and secret_key parameter values.
   
   The configurable paramteres are described in an easy to read YAML format which you are free to adjust to your needs. Following are short descriptions
   of parameters used by Payment application 2:

    1) FQDN              				: https://api.att.com

    2) port              				: port number that application binds to (default: 4567)

    3) api_key           				: set the value as per your registered appliaction 'API key' field value

    4) secret_key        				: set the value as per your registered appliaction 'Secret key' field value

    5) tokens_file       				: file in which OAuth tokens are stored
	
	6) subscriptions_file 				: file in which recent subscriptions are stored
    
	7) recent_subscriptions_stored 		: file which sets the amount of recent subscriptions you would like to store    

	8) payment_redirect_url 			: URL which redirects to application once subscription has taken place

	9) listener_url 					: set to the URL of the notifications callback

	10) notifications_file_dir			: directory which holds all the notification details

	11) notifications_file				: file in which the Notification IDs are stored

	12) notifications_url				: the URL that will display the notifications
	
	13) notificationdetails_file        : file in which the details of the Notification response are stored
	
	
	Following are short descriptions of parameters used by Notary application 1:
	
	1) port                              : 4568

	2) api_key                           : set the value as per your registered appliaction 'API key' field value

	3) secret_key                        : set the value as per your registered appliaction 'Secret key' field value

    	4) FQDN                              : https://api.att.com

	5) payment_redirect	             : URL which redirects back to payment application after notary details have been viewed

4. Running the application

  To run the application, first make sure you have Notary up and running. The Notary application runs from the same directory as the Payment application, type in terminal window:

    ruby ./notary.rb &


  Next, change directory back to the payment application and run it:

    ruby ./app2.rb

  or

    ./app2.rb

  Your application becomes available in a web browser, so you may visit: http://localhost:4567/ to see it working.

  You may interrupt the application at any time by pressing ctrl-C.
