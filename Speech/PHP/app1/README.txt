AT&T API Samples - SpeechToText app 1 
------------------------------ 
This file describes how to set up, configure and run the PHP Applications 
of the AT&T API Platform. 
It covers all steps required to register the application on DevConnect and,
based on the generated API keys and secrets, create and run one's own 
full-fledged sample applications. 
1. Configuration 
2. Installation 
3. Parameters 
 

1. Configuration
Configuration consists of a few steps necessary to get an application
registered on DevConnect with the proper services and 
  endpoints, depending on the type of client-side application
(autonomous/non-autonomous). 

  To register an application, go to https://devconnect-api.att.com/ and login
with your valid username and password.
  Next, choose "My Apps" from the bar at the top of the page and click the
"Setup a New Application" button. 

  Fill in the form, in particular all fields marked as "required". 


  Having your application registered, you will get back an important pair of
data: an API key and Secret key. They are 
  necessary to get your applications working with the AT&T HTML5 APIs. See
'Adjusting parameters' below to learn how to use 
  these keys.

  Initially your newly registered application is restricted to the "Sandbox"
environment only. To move it to production,
  you may promote it by clicking the "Promote to production" button. Notice
that you will get a different API key and secret,
  so these values in your application should be adjusted accordingly.

  Depending on the kind of authentication used, an application may be based on
either the Autonomous Client or the Web-Server 
  Client OAuth flow (see
https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/autonomous-client-application-oauth-flow
or
  https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/web-server-client-application-oauth-flow
respectively).

2. Installation
** Requirements
Apache web server
PHP 5.2+
Apache and PHP configured, on most Linux systems if installed using packages
this will be done automatically.

Copy the sample application folder to Apache web root folder, for example
/var/www/html.
 
3. Parameters
Each sample application contains a config.web file. It holds configurable 
parameters described in an easy to read format. 
Please populate the following parameters in config.web as specified 
below: 
1) api_key : {set the value as per your registered application 
'API key' field value} 
2) secret_key : {set the value as per your registered application 
'Secret key' field value} 
3) endPoint : https://api.att.com 

Note: You must update parameters 1-2 after you promote your application 
from 'Sandbox' environment to 'Production' environment.
