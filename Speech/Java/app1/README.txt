AT&T API Samples - Speech app 1
 ------------------------------

This file describes how to set up, configure and run the Java Applications of the AT&T HTML5 Program sample applications.
It covers all steps required to register the application on DevConnect and, based on the generated API keys and secrets,
create and run one's own full-fledged sample applications.

  1. Configuration
  2. Installation
  3. Parameters
  4. Running the application


1. Configuration

  Configuration consists of a few steps necessary to get an application registered on DevConnect with the proper services and
  endpoints, depending on the type of client-side application (autonomous/non-autonomous).

  To register an application, go to https://devconnect-api.att.com/ and login with your valid username and password.
  Next, choose "My Apps" from the bar at the top of the page and click the "Setup a New Application" button.

  Fill in the form, in particular all fields marked as "required".

  NOTE: You MUST select Speech in the list of services under field 'Services' in order to use this sample application code.

  Having your application registered, you will get back an important pair of data: an API key and Secret key. They are
  necessary to get your applications working with the AT&T HTML5 APIs. See 'Adjusting parameters' below to learn how to use
  these keys.

  Initially your newly registered application is restricted to the "Sandbox" environment only. To move it to production,
  you may promote it by clicking the "Promote to production" button. Notice that you will get a different API key and secret,
  so these values in your application should be adjusted accordingly.

  Depending on the kind of authentication used, an application may be based on either the Autonomous Client or the Web-Server
  Client OAuth flow (see https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/autonomous-client-application-oauth-flow or
  https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth20/web-server-client-application-oauth-flow respectively).


2. Installation

** Requirements

   To run the examples you need a Java environment and at least Apache Tomcat 6, or another Java web server such as Jetty.

** Setting up multiple sample applications simultaneously

   In case multiple applications need to be run at the same time, make sure to put each app in a separate folder and
   adjust your OAuth Redirect URL accordingly.

   
3. Parameters
   
Each sample application contains a config.jsp file. It holds configurable parameters described in an easy to read format.
Please populate the following parameters in config.jsp as specified below:

1) clientIdWeb : {set the value as per your registered appliaction 'API key' field value}

2) clientSecretWeb : {set the value as per your registered appliaction 'Secret key' field value}

3) FQDN : https://api.att.com

Note: If your application is promoted from Sandbox environment to Production environment and you decide to use production
application settings, you must update parameters 1-2 as per production application details.


4. Running the application

  To run the application, put the entire contents of the application folder into a separate folder named SampleApp inside the webapps
  folder in your Apache Tomcat home directory. If you have specified a different home directory in Tomcat for your web applications,
  put it there instead.

  Depending on your security settings in Apache Tomcat, you might need to enable write access to the OauthStorage.jsp file.

  Once you start tomcat, typically using the command "<your-tomcat-root-folder>/bin/startup.sh", your application becomes available
  in a web browser, so you may visit: http://localhost:8080/SampleAppFolder/Speech.jsp to see it working.
