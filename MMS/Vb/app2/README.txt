  AT&T API Samples - MMS app 2
 ------------------------------

This file describes how to set up, configure and run the VB Applications of the AT&T RESTFul sample applications. 
It covers all steps required to register the application on DevConnect and, based on the generated API keys and secrets, 
create and run one's own full-fledged sample applications.

  1. Configuration
  2. Installation
  3. Parameters
  4. Running the application


1. Configuration

  Configuration consists of a few steps necessary to get an application registered on DevConnect with the proper services and 
  endpoints, depending on the type of client-side application (autonomous/non-autonomous). 

  To register an application, go to https://devconnect-api.att.com/ and login with your valid username and password.
  Next, choose "My Apps" from the bar at the top of the page and click the "Setup a New Application" button. 

  Fill in the form, in particular all fields marked as "required".

  Be careful while filling in the "OAuth Redirect URL" field. It should contain the URL that the oAuth provider will redirect
  users to when he/she successfully authenticates and authorizes your application.

NOTE: You MUST select MMS in the list of services under field 'Services' in order to use this sample application code. 

  Having your application registered, you will get back an important pair of data: an API key and Secret key. They are 
  necessary to get your applications working with the AT&T HTML5 APIs. See 'Adjusting parameters' below to learn how to use 
  these keys.

  Initially your newly registered application is restricted to the "Sandbox" environment only. To move it to production,
  you may promote it by clicking the "Promote to production" button. Notice that you will get a different API key and secret,
  so these values in your application should be adjusted accordingly.

  Depending on the kind of authentication used, an application may be based on either the Autonomous Client or the Web-Server 
  Client OAuth flow (see https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth-v1/client-credentials-grant-type or
  https://devconnect-api.att.com/docs/oauth-v1/authorization-code-grant-type respectively).

you must update parameters 1-2 as per production application details.
